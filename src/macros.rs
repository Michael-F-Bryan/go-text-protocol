/// #[allow(missing_docs)]
/// pub enum MyCommand {
///   Play,
///   ShowBoard,
///   UnrecognisedCommand(Option<u32>, String, Vec<String>),

/// Note the `UnrecognisedCommand` variant, this acts as a catch all if you
/// are sent an unknown command.
///
/// The macro also provides a `std::convert::From` impl so you can convert
/// from a `RawCommand` into your command. This allows the parser to
/// transparently convert a line from the `Go Text Protocol` into your custom
/// type.
///

/// # Note
///
/// At the moment the macro isn't complete. In the future I'd like to be able
/// to do something like the following and have the command automatically
/// attach the count and/or args accordingly.
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// custom_command!( enum MyCommand {
///   Play(count, args),
///   ShowBoard,
///   BoardSize(args),
///   Quit,
